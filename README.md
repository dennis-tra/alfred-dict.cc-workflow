[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/dennis-tra/alfred-dict.cc-workflow/total.svg)](https://github.com/dennis-tra/alfred-dict.cc-workflow/releases)

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow to get **bidirectional** translations from [dict.cc](http//dict.cc).

If you like the workflow give this repo a star ‚≠ê

## Download

Click [here](https://github.com/dennis-tra/alfred-dict.cc-workflow/releases/tag/1.1.0) and download `Dict.cc.alfredworkflow`.

## Installation

Just double click the `Dict.cc.alfredworkflow` file and Alfred should pick it up automatically.

Then you need to tell MacOS that it's okay to run the included binary. You have the option to do the following:

<details>
<summary>Security & Privacy Setup</summary>

Beware that the following configuration applies to all workflows you have currently installed and all future ones.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Just allow this binary</summary>

Open the workflow directory

Right click on the `dictcc` binary and select `Open` in the pop up.

This will open a Terminal window and you should see an error message. However, you have now indicated to MacOS that it's okay to run the binary.

Close all windows and you're good to go.

</details>

**Why do I need to do that?**

Since MacOS Catalina, Apple does not allow running arbitrary binaries unless they are notarized. Developers can notarize their binaries if they pay for the Apple Developer Program which is around $100 per year. Since MacOS Monterey, Python 2 is no longer preinstalled and Python 3 only if you install the developer Tools. Hence, I decided to rewrite the Workflow in Go which spits out concise binaries.

## Supported Languages

English, German, French, Swedish, Spanish, Bulgarian, Romanian, Italian, Portuguese, Russian

## Command

`dict lang1 lang2 word_to_translate`

You can omit `lang1` and `lang2` to just translate between german and english (both directions!). [See below](#default-language-pair) to customise the default language pair.

Possible values for `lang1` and `lang2`:

| Abbreviation | Language   |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| en, eng      | english    |
| de, ger      | german     |
| fr, fra      | french     |
| sv, swe      | swedish    |
| es, esp      | spanish    |
| bg, bul      | bulgarian  |
| ro, rom      | romanian   |
| it, ita      | italian    |
| pt, por      | portuguese |
| ru, rus      | russian    |

## Default Language Pair

You may not want the translations to be between english and german by default. To change this behaviour open the Alfred preferences, go to `Workflows`, select `Dict.cc` and click on the `Configure workflow and variables` button in the top right corner.

![Default language setup step 1](./assets/default_language_step_1.png)

You should find the following two workflow environment variables:

1. `from_language`
2. `to_language`

![Default language setup step 2](./assets/default_language_step_2.png)

Assign both variables one of the above abbreviations (either the two letter or three letter form). In the screenshot above the configuration says

* `from_language` - `fra`
* `to_language` - `en`

to translate between french and english by default.

**Note:** Although the variables are named `from_` and `to_` the translations will be bidirectional, so the order shouldn't really matter.

## Development

Build the workflow:

```shell
go build -o dictcc main.go
```

Move the `dictcc` binary to the workflow folder. For development I'd recommend symlinking it.

## Support

It would really make my day if you supported this project through [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dennistra).
